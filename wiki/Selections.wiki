=Purpose=

The purpose of the rocket.selection package is to expose in a browser independent manner the ability to work with selections. The selection module provides a singleton which in turn may be used to manipulate or discover more about a selection that exists on the current page.

=Features=

Using `rocket.selection.client.Selection` and accompanying classes it is possible to perform the following actions. Refer to the javadoc for more 

  * Test if a selection exists
  * Delete from the DOM a selection
  * Read the start and end points of a selection.
  * Programmatically set the start and end points of a selection
  * Surround a selection with a new introduced element.
  * Extract the DOM nodes within a selection and make them a child of another element.

Many of these capabilities make it possible to create a simple rich text editor. A selection may be made bold by surrounding it with a span with a style="weight: bold". The Cut and copy operations may be mimiced by extracting a mouse selection and keeping it on a clipboard. This dom node may then be pasted when the user clicks on a paste button.

=Further samples=

For further examples refer to the unit demo. The demo is interactive and prompts the user to perform or verify each of the capabilities.
